     1. The need for automating repetitive work (reducing errors, improving efficiency)
        - IT opratinons
     	- Provisioning
     	- Configuration Management
     	- Continuous delivery
     	- Application deployment
     	- Security compliance
     	
        
     
     2. Ansible: an open source software provisioning /configuration automation tool
     
        Why it is different?
          - No custom PKI . SSH-based
          - Agentless Architecture (as in Cheff and puppet)
          - Configuration as data not Code
          - Full Configuration management orchestarion and deployment
          
     3. How Ansible work (philosophy and its building blocks)
           - include the image and description from edureka
           
     4. Typical Ansible Use-cases (two simple but non-trivial examples)
           - setting up lab env
		   - install examples from slide
		             
     5. Your first Ansible playbook (example to familiarise the structure and content of a playbook)
     6. More commands (cover essential command and functions here)
     7. Advanced topics (cover 3-4 functions/commands here)
     8. Where to look for more documentation (provide info on/links to documentation) 
     9. Conclusion (recap)
